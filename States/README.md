# States of the artboard — Sketch Plugin

Create different states and switch between them easily. Just like layer comps for Sketch.

  - Define different positions and toggle visibility of your layers.
  - Create new states and update changes.
  - Create pages with new artboards from your states.
  - Since symbols are artboards, you can create states for them too.
  - And yes — The states are saved on your file. Boom.
